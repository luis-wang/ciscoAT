Introduction to Cftc Autotest   

   
CiscoAt to replace manual operation by python design related program .It will more convenient and efficient .You can have more time to pursue issues dearer to your hearts .You don¨t have to stare at the computer .Saving time and manpower .To some extent ,reduce the error rate .Facilitate integrated management ,help to optimize systems upgrade.


1.Installation of Cftc Autotest environment

A compuer with Python(v2.7) Scripts runs on top of Ubuntu13.04 64Bit. 
Install the following plug-ins in advance.
　　　# Install apt-get python-pip
　　　# pip install requests
　　　# pip install progressbar
　　　# pip install pexpect
　　　# pip install python-boxcar


2.Preparation of Cftc Autotest

First , we got CUCM Upgrade ISO 
Second, we make a new xml profile with the same name, which contents info about CUCM cluster. 
　Xml contents like these:   
		EXSI host IP 
		EXSI host username 
		EXSI host password 
		EXSI host datastore 
		EXSI host datacenter 
		Upgrade ISO MD5 
		Upgrade VM info
		Path,ip,user,password 


Xml eg:

<?xml version="1.0"?>
 <CUCMISO>
  <hostip>172.16.128.203</hostip>
  <hostuser>root</hostuser>
  <hostpassword>Cisc012$</hostpassword>
  <datastore>datastore911re</datastore>
  <datacenter>ha-datacenter</datacenter>
  <MD5>78802660C49B2A2C825B1FD85F41BC50</MD5>
  <pubcucmvm>[datastore911re] cucm-pub/cucm-pub.vmx</pubcucmvm>
  <pubcucmip>10.22.223.2</pubcucmip>
  <pubcucmuser>cisco</pubcucmuser>
  <pubcucmpassword>Cisc012$</pubcucmpassword>
  <subcucmvm>[datastore911re] cucm-sub/cucm-sub.vmx</subcucmvm>
  <subcucmip>10.22.223.3</subcucmip>
  <subcucmuser>cisco</subcucmuser>
  <subcucmpassword>Cisc012$</subcucmpassword>
</CUCMISO>



Then preparation steps is 
ISO MD5 check   
Contrast the calculated MD5 value with the MD5 value read from the xml profile 
CUCM version check  
Get the cucm upgrade version from the ISO filename 
Refresh update       
Refresh upgrade will be executed twice, one for Pub cluster and the other for Sub cluster 
Upload ISO    Upload the ISO to the datestore of the tested VM Will be stored in a folder which named by the upload datetime 
Mount ISO  Change the CD/DVD configuration of the tested VM, mount the uploaded ISO 

Finally, enter the order to run the program:    sudo python autotest.py /home/work/ISO/UCSInstall_UCOS_8.6.2.24086-1.sgn.iso 




3.Warning

a.We should keep the CD/DVD drive checkbox of VM setting be checked, When the script running. 

b.User need to make sure the Vmware Tools is running.


4.Analyze logs and failures

If something error , the information will be sent to you(Edit your emails).
You should modify the receiver in the scripts such as autotest.py and autest_web.py in line  29. just as shown bellow:

sender = 'lijunsong@chuwasoft.com'
psw = 're_jy'
receiver = '821090701@qq.com' #modify here 
smtpserver = 'mail.chuwasoft.com'
